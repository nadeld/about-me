# about-me
## TL;DR Dad and Brother's interests in sports especially basketball has hooked me into the realm of sports analytics and learning more about computing and dealing with big data.
My name is David Nadel. I am currently a Freshman at Allegheny College who is interested in majoring in Computer Science. I grew up in Short Hills, New Jersey with two siblings: Eric and Lauren. Both of my siblings have been unconditionally supportive and helpful in my childhood and teenage years.
My interest in computers started when I was about 4 years old and my brother was in his junior high years. One Saturday afternoon during the summer I went up to my brother's room and saw him zoned into the game he was playing on his computer.
