## TL;DR Interest in sports has hooked him into the realm of sports analytics and learning more about computing and dealing with big data.
David Nadel is a Freshman student currently enrolled at Allegheny College who is interested in majoring in Computer Science. He grew up in Short Hills, New Jersey with two siblings: Eric and Lauren. Both of his siblings have been unconditionally supportive and helpful in his childhood and teenage years.

His interest in computers started when he was about 4 years old and his brother was in his junior high years. One Saturday afternoon during the summer he went up to his brother's room and saw him zoned into the game he was playing on his computer. The game Command & Conquer: Yuri's Revenge soon became an addiction for David. In addition, David's sister introduced him to Dance Dance Revolution.

David's interest in computer science was influenced by his father who suggested to him that his love for video and computer games could be further applied into a career.
